| 22 Jan 2019 | Added Presiding Director and Community Secretary names at the end of the document after initial Governance Committee election. |



### Article I: Name

The name of the organization shall be the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) Open Source Community. The short name "CASE Community" shall be used synonymously.

In the remainder of this document, "Community" refers to the CASE Community.


### Article II: Purpose

The Community is organized with the purpose of developing and promoting the adoption of the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) as a Community-developed specification language. The primary motivation for CASE is interoperability that will advance the efficient and accurate exchange of cyber-investigation information between tools and organizations in order to lessen the analytic burden of government and non-government cyber investigators. CASE is intended to serve the needs of a broad range of cyber-investigation domains, including digital forensic science, incident response, counter-terrorism, criminal justice, forensic intelligence, and situational awareness. CASE aligns with and extends the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO).


### Article III: Individual Members


#### 3.1 Section A: Eligibility

An individual may join the Community by submitting a completed membership request form to the CASE Community Governance Committee for approval.


#### 3.2 Section B: Dues

A membership fee schedule may be implemented by the Governance Committee as described in Article V, Section G.


#### 3.3 Section C: Member Classes

There are four classes of members based on the type of organization with which the member is affiliated. Qualifications for Member Class affiliations are described below. Affiliation is by employment, except in the case of independent contributors, who are assigned an affiliation as described below. Every member is affiliated with a member class. In the case that a member has multiple employers of different types, the applicant may self-identify, and the final determination shall be made at the time of membership approval. Class affiliation changes when a member's employment changes.

(a) Industry: Members affiliated with the Industry class must be employed by a for-profit company that has a business license recognized by the local government of the geopolitical region in which they are headquartered. The company must sell a product (_i.e._, good or service) to the digital investigation community for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of trace cyber evidence. For-profit companies that open-source their digital investigations product will belong to the Industry class.

(b) Academia: Members affiliated with the Academia class must be employed by an institution of higher learning or must be independent (_i.e._, otherwise unaffiliated) contributors. The academic institution may be a for-profit or not-for-profit institution of higher learning. The academic institution must have at least one regional accreditation from the country in which it is headquartered. Professional staff of the academic institution must have published an article in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings on the general topic of digital investigations within the previous two years of Community member affiliation. Independent digital investigation researchers and tool developers shall be affiliated with the Academia class following review and approval by the Presiding Director regarding the independent status of the member.

(c) Government: Members affiliated with the Government class must be employed by a local, tribal, state or regional, national, or international governmental body (_e.g._, federal investigative agency, national standards agency, INTERPOL, government computer forensics laboratory, district attorney's office).

(d) Non-Profit: Members affiliated with the Non-Profit class must be employed by an organization that is formally established as a non-profit, not-for-profit, or non-governmental organization, or a similarly chartered entity that works in the public interest by engagement in a digital investigation mission, advocacy for digital investigation standards, or releasing digital investigation tools to the public.


#### 3.4 Section D: Member Status

(a) Active Member: An **active member** shall be a member who has contributed to the CASE Community within a period specified by the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee shall determine the nature and extent of contributions required for active member status. Examples of contributions are: service on the Governance Committee or Ontology Committee, proposal of change requests to the Ontology Committee, attendance at two or more CASE developer meetings, and publicly advocating for the CASE specification language (including presentation of the ontology at a professional meeting, or actions to establish the CASE Community organization). The Secretary will publish the list of names of active members on the Community website as directed by the Governance Committee. The list of active members shall be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis at intervals determined by the Governance Committee and at least once annually prior to the opening of nominations for elected Directors.

The initial determination of active members shall include any person who has contributed to the CASE Community since January 1, 2017, in one or more of the following ways: (i) ontology change contributions; (ii) attendance at two or more CASE developer meetings; or (iii) publicly advocating for the CASE specification language in a professional meeting or online forum.

(b) Emeritus Member: An **emeritus member** is a person who formerly served in one or more Community officer roles for a total of at least three years, who is no longer an active member, and who has retired from their affiliated organization. Emeritus members shall not participate in Community voting.  An emeritus member may be restored to active membership at the determination of the Governance Committee.

(c) Observers: An **observer** is a member who has not contributed to the Community within the period specified by the Governance Committee when a determination of active members is made. Observers shall not participate in Community voting, including elections for the Governance Committee Directors. Observers may request a transfer to active member status if they make contributions to the Community as described in Article III, Section E (a). Observers may request anonymous status, in which case they will not be moved to active status based on participation, unless specifically requested by them.

(a) Presiding Director (voting role): The Presiding Director is a voting member of the Governance Committee and serves as the lead Director of the Governance Committee. The Presiding Director approves the agenda for each Governance Committee meeting and the recorded meeting minutes from the previous meeting. The Presiding Director may act on behalf of the Governance Committee on any item where the Committee would have reasonably provided an affirmative vote in a meeting. The Presiding Director appoints the Secretary and the Treasurer. The Presiding Director always votes last in Governance Committee meetings.

(c) Treasurer (voting role): The Treasurer is appointed by the Presiding Director from the available Directors with voting privileges to serve for the same calendar year. Any Director of the Governance Committee may serve as the Treasurer, except for the Presiding Director. At such time that the CASE Community has a budget, the Presiding Director and the Treasurer will maintain positive control of the funds in a bank account accessible to both Directors, and the Treasurer will present a budget report at each Governance Committee meeting.

(d) Director (voting role): Voting Directors who represent each of the member classes are elected annually by the election process specified in Article V, Section E. Roles and responsibilities for Directors with voting privileges will be designated by a majority affirmative vote of a 60% quorum of eligible voting members of the Governance Committee.

(e) Secretary (non-voting role): The Secretary records the minutes of each meeting to the Community website. The Secretary records the outcomes of all votes taken in Governance Committee meetings for publication to the Community website. The Secretary maintains the list of Ontology Committee members and their organizations. The Secretary will have write privileges to all Community websites. Any Director may fill the Secretary role and maintain their voting membership if approved by the Presiding Director.

(f) Director (non-voting role): The Presiding Director shall appoint a representative recommended by the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) community to a non-voting Director role to ensure collaboration activities between CASE and UCO communities. The Presiding Director may appoint any person to a non-voting Director role for 1 year to conduct any work deemed necessary. The Governance Committee may also appoint additional non-voting Directors as necessary to a term of one year after a majority vote in the affirmative from a quorum of 60% is established.

(g) CASE Technical Director (non-voting role): The CASE Technical Director will attend each meeting of the Governance Committee as a non-voting member unless also serving in a voting Director role. The Technical Director may not serve simultaneously as the Presiding Director. The Technical Director will provide regular updates to the Governance Committee on the technical goals and achievements of the Ontology Committee. The Technical Director is a voting member of the Ontology Committee.


#### 5.5 Section E: Term, Nomination, and Election of Governance Committee Members

(a) Term: All Governance Committee roles are held from January 1 through December 31, plus any remainder of the first year after these bylaws are adopted by the Community. Each elected Director serves for a term of 1 year and may be re-elected to the same position for no more than 3 consecutive years. Directors may be returned after an absence of 1 year.

(b) Annual Nomination and Election of Governance Committee Directors (voting): The Presiding Director will appoint two representatives to facilitate the annual election of Governance Committee Directors. The Presiding Director will allow for a 30-day nominating period prior to holding the elections. At the start of the nominating period, the two representatives will publish a call for nominations for each Governance Committee Director role, together with the date of the election.

(i) Any active member of the CASE Community may nominate any active member (including self-nomination) to any Director role representing the member class aligned with their professional employment.

(ii) Nominees for Presiding Director must have served one full year, within the previous 7 years, as a voting member of the Governance Committee prior to taking office as the Presiding Director. This condition is waived for the inaugural Presiding Director, who shall be nominated and elected according to the rules set forth in the clause specifying the _Initial Governance Committee Elections Process_ (Article V, Section E).

(iii) The same person may be nominated to both the Presiding Director and a representative Director role; however, those roles cannot be held concurrently.

(iv) The CASE Technical Director is nominated and elected at the same time as the voting Governance Committee Directors.

Before the end of the nominating period, the Secretary will publish to the Community website the names, employers, member class, and short biographies of all candidates who have accepted nomination. The election shall be held no less than one week, and no more than three weeks, after the close of nominating period. Elections shall be completed before October 15 of the election year.  Community members will vote by secret ballot for a single nominee to represent each member class; for the Presiding Director; and for the CASE Technical Director. The representatives will provide the voting mechanism (e.g., website or email voting). Nominees with a simple majority of votes will win the vote for that position. In the case of a tie, there shall be a run-off election between the tied candidates. If a nominee to both the Presiding Director and a representative Director position has received the majority of votes for both positions, then the nominee will choose which position to hold. The nominee with the next highest number of votes for the remaining position will hold that position. The election results will be certified in writing by the two representatives, and this certificate will be retained as a record by the new Governing Committee. Election results will be published to the Community website by the Secretary. The outgoing Presiding Director shall organize and hold a transition meeting with the incoming Governance Committee Directors. New Directors will take their positions on January 1 of the following year and serve until December 31 (unless re-elected to their position).

(c) Initial Governance Committee Election Process: After these bylaws are adopted in accordance with the rules set forth in the Adoption of Bylaws clause, active contributors of the Community will appoint two representatives to facilitate the initial election of the Governance Committee Directors. The representatives will announce the date of the election through the Community website and all available communication channels. Thirty (30) days prior to the election, the representatives will publish a call for nominations for each Governance Committee Director role. The representatives shall publish to the Community website the names of all candidates who have accepted the nomination for each position, also the names of their employers and a short biography of each nominee. Community members will vote, and results will be determined, certified, and published, as described in the above section on Annual Nomination and Election of Governance Committee Directors. Inaugural Directors will take their positions immediately following certification of the election, serving a regular term from January 1 to December 31, as well as any portion of the preceding year.
